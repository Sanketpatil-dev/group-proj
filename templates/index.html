        <h3 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold">Commitment to Safety</h3>

        <p>The strong safety culture at Pathways is supported by continual investments 
          in a top-of-the-line fleet, cutting-edge safety gear, regular training, and 
          strict sanitary procedures. As opposed to the industry norm of every six and a 
          half years, we continue to invest in our current fleet of Volvo 9700 coaches each 
          year, giving our drivers access to vital support systems and the newest technologies
           for passenger comfort. All of our coaches now come equipped with Volvo's Driver Support 
           System (DSS), which includes AEBS (advanced emergency braking and front collision warning systems),
            LKS (lane keeping support), and ACC (adaptive cruise control). Pathways was honored to take part in
             the DSS testing process because it has a history of being the first to introduce innovative ideas
              in driver and passenger safety..</p>
